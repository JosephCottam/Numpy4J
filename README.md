Numpy4J
=======

Interface Java with Numpy.  Try not to suck.


Right now, you can make a java byte buffer, stuff it full of integers and get numpy to tell you the maximum value.

Build
------

In the Numpy4J directory, run "ant".

To also test it, do "ant exec".

To build and then run "ant build exec".
